# 🛒 E-Commerce System in Java

A complete **Java console-based e-commerce platform** that supports **customer registration, login, product carting, checkout with shipping**, and robust validation mechanisms. This system features both **Admin** and **Customer** roles with prefilled data for ease of testing and simulation.

## Features

### Admin Role
- Validates customer login credentials
- Ensures password and email meet specific criteria
- Displays available products with full details
- Tracks product expiration and shipping requirements
- Calculates item price and shipping cost
- Updates quantity and product availability status
- Handles shipment processing for shipping-eligible items

### Customer Role
- Register using a secure password and Gmail address
- Log in using username and password
- Add available products to their cart (limited to 20 items max)
- Automatically see cart load capacity
- Checkout with calculated total and shipping fees
- Balance is automatically updated

## Product Features

Each `Product` supports:
- Name, Price, Quantity
- Expiration status and time (if applicable)
- Shipping requirements (optional)
- Weight (used for shipping calculations)
- Stock availability (`In stock`, `Out of stock`)

If a product requires shipping, it implements:

```java
public interface Shipping {
    String getName();
    double getWeight();
}
```

> Shipping fee is calculated as `10$ per kg * weight * quantity`.

## Validation

### Password Validation
- At least 8 characters long
- Contains at least:
  - One lowercase letter
  - One uppercase letter
  - One digit
  - One special character (`@#$%^&+=!`)

### Email Validation

```
example@gmail.com
